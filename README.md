1.) The first thing I did was set up the dependencies for the project using npm init.
    - using the "-y" allows you to set up the package.json file without having
    to input anything.

2.) The first package I installed is "node-sass" which is a node compiler for sass.  

3.) Next I set up script in the package.json file, that watches a sass file, and compiles the sass into a css file. 
    - "node-sass -w scss/ -o css/" <-- this syntax "watches a sass file for changes and then outputs the compiled sass into a css file.

4.)I set up an index.html file, and insert links to my compliled css as well as some other styling and meta tags for cross-device compatibility"
